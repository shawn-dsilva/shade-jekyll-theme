title: About Me
---
I am Shawn Dâ€™silva, a full stack developer using the versatility of JavaScript and an electronics hobbyist.

The purpose of this website is to document my projects and other blog posts related to Web fevelopment, Embedded Linux, RTOSes, hobby Electronics and Microcontroller Firmware programming.

I am fascinated about the low-level, inner workings of computers and modern electronics in general that are abstracted away from the average user, both hardware and firmware, and love reading material related to Computer Architecture and Digital Electronics
