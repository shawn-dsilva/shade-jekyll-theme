            <p>I believe that good code should have clear and concise <span class="dotted-blu">Documentation</span>, and
            therefore endeavor to use my <span class="dotted-blu">Blog</span> and <span class="dotted-blu">Github</span>
            to share anything new that i have learnt, or
            document my projects</p>
