title: 'ASUS X510UNR : Best Budget Linux laptop'
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

I was at a Croma store window shopping when i happened upon this laptop,the **Asus X510UNR**.
Usually,people recommend laptops like those from the **Thinkpad** line,Dell **XPS** line and other such business class laptops for optimal **Linux** compatibility,considering they have **Intel WiFi** cards that are known to be well supported in **Linux** based systems,because Intel actively provides drivers and firmware for these cards And also because of the  high quality components,larger batteries,materials and 3 year warranty that come with these Business-class laptops

 <!--more-->

But all these however,come at a steep price,most business grade laptops start at around the **1 Lakh INR** range,with no option except to play Russian roulette with budget laptops that may not have the correct parts for an optimal Linux experience,with various incompatibilities,people on the internet seem to recommend some 5-6 year old used Thinkpads that cost about 22K INR,for running linux,and although these things are "Built like tanks" they are too old and bulky for my purposes. This is where the **Asus X510UNR** surprisingly comes in, with it's good specs and relatively cheap price of around **58K MRP**,altough i got it for around **48K INR** because of some Diwali offers Croma was running.<br>

# Laptop Review

The screen is some kind of TN Panel i think, because Asus doesn't seem to mention the panel type anywhere.
It is 1080p, but color reproduction and viewing angles are bad,The default scaling lets you get more screen real estate compared to a 720p display, a boon for programmers like me.
The speakers are decent,not too low volume, not too loud,just average.
<br>
The keyboard is decent to type on, and has a backlight whose intensity can be controlled by the Function Keys, The touchpad is one of the clickable ones,with no physical left,right or middle click keys, further
the top right of the touchpad is taken up by the finger print reader.
<br>
Thermals seem to be ok,with the laptop idling at 38 C and reaching 45 C on light load,altought the laptop gets hot while charging.
<br>
By default the Windows 10 installation comes with pre-installed bloatware just like any other manufacturer, This makes no difference to me,as i run Ubuntu anyway



# Linux Compatibility

I installed **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** on this laptop,which is my daily driver for programming and related work.<br>
My workload mainly consists of **NodeJs**, **MongoDB** and **Angular6**, all three of whose servers i have running all the time,i also use **GCC/Make** for **C** building and compilation sometimes.
<br>
The **X510UNR** is fully functional out of the box,with all the function key's alternate functions like screen brightness, keyboard backlight,audio volume,airplane mode,sleep etc all working The only packages that have to be downloaded are the **Proprietary Nvidia drivers**

```
sudo apt install nvidia-340
```

and **TLP** and **PowerTop** for battery saving

```
sudo apt install tlp powertop
```

As mentioned before, nearly everything works,but i will list them below just for convinience

- **WiFi & Bluetooth** : <span style="color: green; font-weight:400;">WORKS</span><br>
  unlike other laptops with Wifi cards from **Qualcomm** or **Realtek**,the **Intel WiFi** card works flawlessly,never once dropping connection and getting download speeds of **10 MB/s**
- **Graphics** : <span style="color: green; font-weight:400;">WORKS</span><br>
  Both the **UHD 620** and **MX150** work out of the box,with no need to set `nomodeset` while installing
- **Power Management** : <span style="color: green; font-weight:400;">WORKS</span><br>
  at around 15% brightness i can get around 5-6 hours of usage,**powertop** and **TLP** enabled,with the Nvidia GPU disabled
- **Finger Print Reader** : <span style="color: red; font-weight:400;">DOESN'T WORK</span><br>
  I have no use for a finger print reader,so this is not a deal-breaker for me
- **Audio** : <span style="color: green; font-weight:400;">WORKS</span>
- **Touchpad** : <span style="color: green; font-weight:400;">WORKS</span>
- **Camera** : <span style="color: green; font-weight:400;">WORKS</span>
- **Keyboard Backlight** : <span style="color: green; font-weight:400;">WORKS</span>
- **Function/Multimedia Keys** : <span style="color: green; font-weight:400;">WORKS</span>
- **Sleep and Wake** : <span style="color: green; font-weight:400;">WORKS</span>

# Build Quality/ Durability :

Altough this device packs all this hardware,and is yet still light,it is clear that Asus had to skimp out on the build quality of this laptop.
<br>

The plastic has this brushed metal finish on the lid,which makes it look very cheap,and is a finger-print magnet, 
the chassis plastic seems flimsy and i can see a slight depression on the plastic between the 'G' and 'H' keys of the keyboard
There is a lot of flex overall, altough the laptop can be opened with one hand most of the time(a small notch is provided,like you would see on a macbook).
<br>

The venting is inadequate,with only one narrow,yet long vent at the back of the laptop,in front of the hinge,this will cause airflow issues in the future,altough for now it doesn't seem to get hot.
<br>

On the literal flipside of this though,is a removable bottom cover,which is attached to the case by around 10 screws of the Phillips #000 variety it seems, This gives you easy access to the internals of this laptop,the battery modules are sadly **glued** to the casing it seems,hindering replace-ability


# Conclusion

Overall this is a good "It-Just-Works" **Linux** laptop in this price range of **60,000 INR**, with good hardware, 
<br> out-of-the-box Linux support and relative ease of maintainence and upgradability.
<br>
altough the materials and finish leave something to be desired
