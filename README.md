Repo for my website,uses Hyde theme by mdo with a modified _config.yml file to make it work with jekyll 3.x

## Changes from stock Hyde/Poole
- Uses excerpts instead of displaying full post content
- No underline on links when hovering(except post title links to full posts)
- Post titles on the homepage have blue color now instead of the default black
- Post width of `250px` using `margin-right:` in css
- set `baseurl` to `/` while testing,but to `shawn-dsilva.github.io` for deploying on GH Pages
