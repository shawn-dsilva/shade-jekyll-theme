## Changes from stock Hyde/Poole
- Uses excerpts instead of displaying full post content
- No underline on links when hovering(except post title links to full posts)
- set `baseurl` to `/` while testing,but to `shawn-dsilva.github.io` for deploying on GH Pages
- uses `highlight.js` with `atom-one-dark` syntax highlight theme compared to `rouge` or `pygments`
- code snippets using backticks have black text on grey background now
- Read More button added to home page posts
- Font-family changed site wide to Source Sans Pro
- Workaround for Bold/Strong fonts that look "think" added
